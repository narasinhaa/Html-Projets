                    His saga is the entrepreneurial creation myth writ large: Steve Jobs cofounded Apple in his parents'
                    garage in 1976,
                    was ousted in 1985, returned to rescue it from near bankruptcy in 1997, and by the time he died, in
                    October 2011,
                    had built it into the world’s most valuable company. Along the way he helped to transform seven
                    industries:
                    personal computing, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, retail stores, and digital
                    publishing.
                    He thus belongs in the pantheon of America’s great innovators.
                    <br><br>
                    He was also a master marketer, and he was able to take products that were completely new and make
                    them into must-haves for consumers.
                    <br><br>
                    Jobs' philosophy was to make products that were at the intersection of art and technology,
                    intuitiveness and design.
                    His openness to being inspired allowed him to live his philosophy, and in turn inspire others.
